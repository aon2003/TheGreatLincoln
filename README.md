# TheGreatLincoln

TheGreatLinkoln is a project created by [me](https://github.com/aon2003) and [Xander](https://github.com/Alexander1022) in 2 weeks for the mandatory manufacturing practice we had in 11th grade in ELSYS. The technologies we have used are [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) and [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/). We store the working information in Google Sheets.

------------

Who's TheGreatLinkoln?! He's a web service communicating with Slack, which subscribes employees to important public messages. He's a bot. The importance of the messages is calculated by the number of reactions the message has. There are more things the bot can do which are described in the picture of the help option of the bot below.

------------

The project is not 100% complete so the bot is not published in Slack App Directory. If you want to try it you can read the [Wiki](https://github.com/aon2003/TheGreatLincoln/wiki) for the installation process.
